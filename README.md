# VendorFlow - Vendor Onboarding Automation

**Onboard vendors in 1 day instead of 3 weeks.**

## 🎯 The Problem

Mid-market companies (20-200 employees) waste 2-3 weeks onboarding each new vendor through:
- Endless email chains chasing W-9s, bank details, and insurance certificates
- Manual data entry into Excel/accounting systems
- Lost documents and compliance risks
- $12,500+ wasted annually in labor costs

Enterprise tools ($50K-500K+) are too expensive and complex for mid-market companies.

## ✅ The Solution

VendorFlow is a simple $149/month tool that automates vendor onboarding:

1. **Send vendor a form link** - One click, no attachments
2. **Vendor fills standardized form** - All info in one place
3. **Automatic validation** - Checks EIN, bank routing, insurance expiration
4. **Review & approve** - Clean dashboard for procurement team
5. **Export to accounting** - CSV for QuickBooks, NetSuite, etc.

## 📊 Results

- **3 weeks → 1 day** onboarding time
- **5+ hours saved** per vendor
- **90% less cost** than enterprise tools
- **40% ROI** for companies onboarding 10+ vendors/year
